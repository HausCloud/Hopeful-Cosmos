# Introduction üí°

Hopeful Cosmos is a web application where visitors and explore other users wishes and make their own. Once a wish is made it is added to the screen. You can hover over the star and click on it to see what wish was made.

A card will appear detailing the following information: 
- Name of the star
- Who the wish was made by
- Where the wish was made if the user allows the web app to use their location, i.e, New Haven, CT.
